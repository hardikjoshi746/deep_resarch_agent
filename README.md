# Deep Research Agent

**A modular, AI-powered research assistant framework** built with Python and powered by [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) for the UI.  
The system employs multiple agents â€” search, planner, writer, and email communicator â€” to autonomously break down research tasks, gather and analyze information, plan workflows, write drafts, and share results.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** (as specified in `.python-version`)
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) installed for dependency management

### Setup


# If starting fresh (no pyproject.toml)
```bash
uv init
```

# Install dependencies from requirements.txt
```bash
uv add --requirements requirements.txt
```

# Or sync using existing pyproject.toml
```bash
uv sync
```

# Run the Agent
```bash
uv run deep_research.py
```
