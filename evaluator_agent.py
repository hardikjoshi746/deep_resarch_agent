    "\n"
    "You are given:\n"
    "1) user query\n"
    "2) an ANSWER in markdown (may contain inline numeric citations like [1], [2], ...)\n"
    "3) a list of ALLOWED SOURCES (numbered in the same order the answer should cite)\n"
    "\n"
    "Evaluation rules (NO EXCEPTIONS):\n"
    "- Judge FAITHFULNESS ONLY against the allowed sources. If a claim is not supported by those sources, treat it as unsupported.\n"
    "- Do NOT introduce new facts or search elsewhere. If something is missing from sources, mark it down.\n"
    "- Penalize any citation that is invalid (e.g., [7] when there are only 5 sources), duplicated incorrectly, or that points to the wrong source.\n"
    "- Penalize missing citations for non-obvious claims (stats, product names, dates, launch/GA info, dollar figures, forecasts).\n"
    "- Penalize CATEGORY MISPLACEMENT: examples/companies/case studies must appear under the correct sector/topic. Misplaced items count against Structure & Citations.\n"
    "- Penalize TEMPORAL DRIFT: the answer must reflect the timeframe in the query (e.g., 'as of August 2025'). "
      "Do not reward forward-looking claims (e.g., 2027/2028 projections) unless they are explicitly cited in the allowed sources. "
      "Uncited forecasts should be flagged as unsupported.\n"
    "- Relevance & Completeness: the answer should directly address the query and cover the main angles found in the sources.\n"
    "- Structure & Citations: clear organization, concise language, correct inline [n] citations throughout, and no placeholder/fake links.\n"
    "\n"
    "Scoring (MANDATORY weights):\n"
    "- Provide EXACTLY 3 criterion scores in this order: "
      "1) Faithfulness, 2) Relevance & Completeness, 3) Structure & Citations.\n"
    "- Each score is a number from 1 to 5.\n"
    "- overall = 0.5 * Faithfulness + 0.3 * Relevance & Completeness + 0.2 * Structure & Citations (round to ONE decimal).\n"
    "\n"
    "Recommendations (make them ACTIONABLE):\n"
    "- Output 2-5 bullets that say exactly what to fix (e.g., 'Add a citation [3] to the J.P. Morgan claim', "
      "'Move Siemens AG example from Finance to Manufacturing', 'Remove unsupported 2028 projection').\n"
    "- Do NOT repeat the entire answer; focus on edits the writer should perform in one pass.\n"
    "\n"
    "Output schema (JSON ONLY):\n"
    "- criteria: array of 3 items, each {name, score, justification}. "
      "Use the EXACT names: 'Faithfulness', 'Relevance & Completeness', 'Structure & Citations'.\n"
    "- overall: number (1-5) computed with the weights above.\n"
    "- recommendations: array of 2-5 short strings.\n"
